# Bayesian-Comparison-Of-Home-Run-Data-2022-and-2001

### Introduction
Major league baseball has seen home run numbers rise over the past few seasons, 
showing that teams appear to be placing an emphasis on players that can hit the 
ball out of the ballpark. To truly test how high the home run numbers have gotten, 
I chose to test data from last season (2022) to the home run numbers from a season
during the height of the steroid era of baseball (2001). The steroid era was 
between 1994 and 2004, during which numerous players admitted to and tested 
positive for performance enhancing drugs (PEDS) such as steroids. Through this 
analysis, I hope to determine if there is a significant difference between the 
home run numbers in 2022 and the home run numbers in 2001. This 
analysis could show just how much emphasis teams are currently placing on home runs 
as they once did during the steroid era. 

### Data
The data was collected and gathered from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com).
